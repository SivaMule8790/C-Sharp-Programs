/*Library Management System:

Consider you are a software developer at a library. The library has a system where each book is 
represented by an instance of the Books class. The Books class has the following 
attributes: bookName, authorName, quantity, and an array books that stores the names of the books.

The Books constructor takes the book name, author name, and quantity as parameters.
If the quantity is more than 10, it prints “Cannot add more than 10 books”.
 Otherwise, it creates an array of size equal to the quantity and fills it with the book name.

Your task is to create displayBooks method that prints the names of the books in the books array. 
Also in the Main.java file, take the inputs using command line arguments and create Books instance and call the displayBooks method
