/*
In C#, **partial classes** allow you to split the definition of a class, struct, or interface across multiple files. 
This feature is particularly useful for organizing large classes, separating auto-generated code from user-defined code, and improving code maintainability.

### Key Features of Partial Classes

1. **Multiple Files**: A partial class can be defined in multiple files, and the compiler combines them into a single class during compilation.

2. **Same Namespace**: All parts of a partial class must be in the same namespace.

3. **Same Accessibility**: All parts of a partial class must have the same access modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`).

4. **Combining Members**: All members (methods, properties, fields, etc.) defined in the different parts of the partial class are combined into a single class.

5. **Auto-Generated Code**: Partial classes are often used in scenarios where code is auto-generated (e.g., by designers in Windows Forms or ASP.NET) to separate user-defined code from auto-generated code.

### Example of Partial Classes

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use partial classes in C#.

#### File 1: `Person.Part1.cs`

```csharp
using System;

namespace PartialClassExample
{
    public partial class Person
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        public void DisplayFullName()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Full Name: {FirstName} {LastName}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### File 2: `Person.Part2.cs`

```csharp
using System;

namespace PartialClassExample
{
    public partial class Person
    {
        public int Age { get; set; }

        public void DisplayAge()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Age: {Age}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Main Program: `Program.cs`

```csharp
using System;

namespace PartialClassExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Person person = new Person
            {
                FirstName = "John",
                LastName = "Doe",
                Age = 30
            };

            person.DisplayFullName(); // Output: Full Name: John Doe
            person.DisplayAge();       // Output: Age: 30
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Partial Class Definition**:
   - The `Person` class is defined in two separate files (`Person.Part1.cs` and `Person.Part2.cs`).
   - Both parts of the class are marked with the `partial` keyword, indicating that they are parts of the same class.

2. **Properties and Methods**:
   - In `Person.Part1.cs`, the properties `FirstName` and `LastName` are defined, along with the method `DisplayFullName()`.
   - In `Person.Part2.cs`, the property `Age` and the method `DisplayAge()` are defined.

3. **Combining Members**:
   - When the program is compiled, the compiler combines both parts of the `Person` class into a single class with all the properties and methods.

4. **Main Program**:
   - In the `Main` method, an instance of `Person` is created, and the properties are set. The methods `DisplayFullName()` and `DisplayAge()` are called to display the person's full name and age.

### Benefits of Using Partial Classes

1. **Organization**: Partial classes help organize code better, especially for large classes, by allowing you to separate related functionality into different files.

2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the same class simultaneously without causing merge conflicts.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: You can separate auto-generated code (like designer files) from user-defined code, making it easier to manage and maintain.

4. **Maintainability**: It improves maintainability by allowing you to keep related code together while still separating concerns.

### Conclusion

Partial classes in C# are a powerful feature that enhances code organization, collaboration, and maintainability. 
They allow you to split class definitions across multiple files, making it easier to manage large classes and separate auto-generated code from user-defined code.
 This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where classes grow large or when working with code generation tools.
